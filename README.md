# ConsultationManagement
The Faculty Consultation Appointment Management System is designed to streamline and enhance the process of scheduling consultations between students and faculty and staff members. This user-friendly application allows students to seamlessly request appointments with their academic advisors, specific faculty members, and department staffs. The system provides real-time availability information, enabling students to check the schedule of that personnel and receive specific remarks about their availability status.

In cases where the desired faculty member or staff is not available, the system facilitates the creation of appointment requests. These requests are then efficiently managed by the faculty and staff members, who can view and respond to them through the system.
